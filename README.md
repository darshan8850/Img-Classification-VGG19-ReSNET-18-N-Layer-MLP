# Image Classification over CIFAR10 dataset using VGG19, ResNet18, and n-layer MLP

Welcome to the Image Classification over CIFAR10 dataset using VGG19, ResNet18, and n-layer MLP GitHub repository!

This repository contains the code for training and evaluating image classification models over the CIFAR10 dataset using the VGG19, ResNet18, and n-layer MLP architectures. The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Getting Started
 
 ### To get started, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine by running:
  
  ```git clone https://github.com/darshan8850/Img-Classification-VGG19-ReSNET-18-N-Layer-MLP```
  
 ### Make sure you have a GPU before running the code as the models are very deep and training on CPU will be computationally expensive or else use Google Colab.

## Conclusion
This repository contains the implementation of three popular architectures for image classification - VGG19, ResNet18, and n-layer MLP. The code is easy to understand, modify, and extend. You can also try using different hyperparameters and regularization techniques to further improve the performance of the models.

I hope this repository is helpful for your image classification tasks. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

## Happy coding!
